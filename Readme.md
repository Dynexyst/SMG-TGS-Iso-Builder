Super Mario Galaxy The Green Stars is a free to play ROM hack that adds hidden green stars to the original stages of SMG1 just like the aftergame of SMG2.
Some will be difficult to collect while others may be a bit easier, but more hidden. Grand stars are hidden as well.

About secret stars:
Every large galaxy (one with more than 2 stars in the original game) has 2 secret stars:
-Secret star 1 will always be in mission 1.
-Secret star 2 will be in either mission 2 or 3. You just have to find it. :P (See Bug List.txt)

DO NOT PLAY BOWSER JR'S ROBOT REACTOR (Megaleg) IF YOU HAVE EXACTLY 12 STARS! 8-11 and 13+ IS OKAY. (See Bug List.txt)

Instructions:
-Place a Super Mario Galaxy disc image into this folder
-Run Builder.bat
-READ "Bug List.txt"
-You can now run the game with your preferred method (for example: USB Loader GX or Dolphin)
-Start a new Mario file or:
To play as Luigi:
You must have a 100% complete Mario save file. (Refer to Bug List.txt)

Have fun!
