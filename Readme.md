**__Thank you for using my Iso Builder for SMG, The Green Stars__**

**Requirements**

Wiimm's ISO Tools (or WIT for short), you can get it here: https://wit.wiimm.de/

**Usage**

- Place a .iso file (.wbfs, .wdf, .wia and some other formats also supported) of SMG into the iso builder folder and run Builder.bat.

- There are instructions on-screen but if you just want an .iso to use on dolphin:
	1. Choose 1, 2, 3 or 4  (in this case choose 1).
	2. Type in the name of your SMG disc image (e. g. SMG.iso).
	3. Type in a name for the new, modded SMG disc image. (e. g. SMG, The Green Stars.iso)
	4. Wait until the modded disc image finishes building.

**Hack Description**

Super Mario Galaxy The Green Stars is a free to play ROM hack that adds hidden green stars to the original stages of SMG1 just like the aftergame of SMG2.
Some will be difficult to collect while others may be a bit easier, but more hidden. Grand stars are hidden as well.

About secret stars:

Every large galaxy (one with more than 2 stars in the original game) has 2 secret stars:

-Secret star 1 will always be in mission 1.

-Secret star 2 will be in either mission 2 or 3. You just have to find it. :P (See Bug List.txt)

DO NOT PLAY BOWSER JR'S ROBOT REACTOR (Megaleg) IF YOU HAVE EXACTLY 12 STARS! 8-11 and 13+ IS OKAY. (See Bug List.txt)

Instructions:

  1. Place a Super Mario Galaxy disc image into this folder

  2. Run Builder.bat

  3. READ "Bug List.txt"

  4. You can now run the game with your preferred method (for example: USB Loader GX or Dolphin)

  5. Start a new Mario file or:

To play as Luigi:

  You must have a 100% complete Mario save file. (Refer to Bug List.txt)

Have fun!
